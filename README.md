We need you to build a website with 3 parts.

·        The first part, a search page where the patients should be able to search the doctors nearby them.

·         The second part should have a login/register facility for doctors, where the doctor should be able to make their profile so that when the patient searches for doctors their profile should be visible if the doctor is near to the patient.

·         The third part should also have a login/register facility for the manufacturers who are supplying medical materials to the doctors, here the manufacturers can upload and list out the products which they want to sell. This portal should be an eCommerce portal with an option to select the products and order them then and there. This part should ONLY be visible to the doctors, ONLY when they sign in.

 

As this is a test website, we need you to design it in a way that:

·          It has 2-3 doctors registered and 2-3 manufacturers registered with 4 products listed each in their profile so that when a patient search for a doctor, then those 2-3 registered doctors’ should appear to him.

·         When the doctor searches for the manufacturers, then those 2-3 registered manufacturers’ list should appear with their products and prices.
